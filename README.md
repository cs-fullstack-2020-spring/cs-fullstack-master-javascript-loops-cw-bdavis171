# JavaScript Loops Classwork

## For Loops

### Exercise 1:
- Use a for loop to print numbers -3 through 8

### Exercise 2:
- Use a for loop to count from -5 to 5 three times in a row

### Exercise 3:
- Use a for loop to print only even numbers from -50 to 50

### Exercise 4:
Start with the following array:
`let high_scores = [2112, 1024, 9000, 9001, 7200, 2600, 10000]`

- Use a for loop to print each score
- If the score is greater than 9000 print the score and the text `OVER 9000!`
Expected Output:
```
HIGH SCORES

2112
1024
9000
9001 OVER 9000!
7200
2600
10000 OVER 9000!
```

### Exercise 5:
- Prompt the user to enter a number 
- Prompt the user to enter another number 
- Create a for loop that counts from the first number to the second number they entered


## While/Do While Loops

### Exercise A:
- Print -10 through 5 using a counter and while loop.

### Exercise B:
- Write a While loop that counts backwards from 10 to 0
- Log the current count at the end of each iteration EXCEPT if the current count is ```5```

### Exercise C:
- Create an empty `name_array`
- Ask the user ```Enter a word. Enter 'q' to quit.``` Add each word they enter to the array
- Create a while loop that will keep asking for words to add to the array until they enter 'q'
- When the user enters 'q' use a **for** loop to print each word from the array
